==Minio Demo

===Installation

Install MinIO: https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-quickstart-guide.html
Install NginX: https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/installing-nginx/installing-nginx-open-source/

===Setup NginX as a mTLS proxy
see server template: [nginx/servers/minio](./nginx/servers/minio)

The certificates and keys needed for setting up mTLS is available under [certs](./certs)

Please change the following folders in the [nginx/servers/minio](./nginx/servers/minio) so that they point to the certificates in the [certs](./certs) folder.

The following properties in [nginx/servers/minio](./nginx/servers/minio) needs to be changed:

- ssl_certificate
- ssl_certificate_key
- ssl_client_certificate

The [nginx/servers/minio](./nginx/servers/minio) needs to be moved to the nginx/servers folder so that it is loaded when restarting nginx.

After installing and starting MinIO and NginX Please verify that mTLS is working by doing the following:

    curl --verbose -X POST -d '{"someparam1":"somevalue1","someparam2":"somevalue2"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -k https://localhost:8092 --cert certs/client.pem --key certs/client.key

After the client and server TLS handshake you should see: `SSL connection using TLSv1.2`
