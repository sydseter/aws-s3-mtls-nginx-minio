===Installation

Install MinIO: https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-quickstart-guide.html

===Setup NginX as a mTLS proxy
see server template: [nginx/servers/minio](./nginx/servers/minio)

The certificates and keys needed for setting up mTLS is available under [certs](./certs)

Please change the following folders in the [nginx/servers/minio](./nginx/servers/minio) so that they point to the certificates in the [certs](./certs) folder.

The following properties in [nginx/servers/minio](./nginx/servers/minio) needs to be changed:

- ssl_certificate
- ssl_certificate_key
- ssl_client_certificate

The [nginx/servers/minio](./nginx/servers/minio) needs to be moved to the nginx/servers folder so that it is loaded when restarting nginx.
